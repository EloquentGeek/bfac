## What's a game engine?

Honestly, when I started learning about games I thought I knew what a game engine was. Something
that gave me a higher-level [API](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/API) to draw graphics and play sounds, maybe some input handling. I
knew some of them provided an ability to distribute games cross-platform (develop on Linux, deploy
everywhere) and some supported drag-and-drop or point-and-click development.

I honestly didn't pay much attention to the big name engines and why people chose them. My childhood
memories were of people I looked up to writing games in assembly language and C, often developing
their own toolkits to assist in the process.

Turns out, engines evolved since then. The majors encompass one or more of the following features:

- sprite editing and animation previews
- tilemap editing
- visual UI editing/formatting
- drag and drop or code-lite development (sometimes referred to as a "blueprint" feature, especially in the Unreal
  Engine community)
- built-in code editing, analogous to an external editor but often with "batteries included":
  abilities specific to the engine or Language Server Protocol-like behaviours for the built-in
  language
- live preview of the game in a debugger with various features often including the ability to alter
  code or specific values and have the change appear in real time
- distribution pipelines for various platforms, including mobile devices

And the list goes on.

There are [plenty of game engines](https://enginesdatabase.com) available, including at least one
for most major platforms and languages. If you ask most people in and around the community, they'll
recognise at least one of the following.

## Unity

One of the most popular engines, [Unity](https://unity.com) is wildly popular in both professional
and amateur gamedev communities. A core strength is cross-platform distribution, including reliable
support for mobile devices. Development language is C#. A [wildly-unpopular licensing agreement](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Uniy_(game_engine)#Runtime_fee_reception) was
modified in late 2024.
