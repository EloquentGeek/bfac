### Well, it's like this...

As I write this, I'm fifty-two years old.

I was born before the Internet.

I still remember computers without mass storage devices.

I have owned landline phones with rotary dials on them.

Hence the _Aged_. Sure, it's a little tongue-in-cheek, but that's honestly how I feel sometimes when
I'm working on a hard problem. Old. Slow. Plodding.

But _stubborn_. I think that's my saving grace, and my best advce when approaching new subjects. I
started learning game development oh, approximately a year ago. I'm no expert! But I'll become one
eventually, and in the meantime I'll build this book.

It won't always be perfect, and it might not even always represent the best solutions to every
problem. But if I can possibly manage it, it'll stay up to date.
