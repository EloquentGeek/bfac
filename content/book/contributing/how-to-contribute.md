### Why?

All the usual OSS reasons: more eyes is better than fewer eyes when it comes to finding problems. It
makes sense to have community input for a community-developed project like Bevy Engine. And, since
I'm not an expert, ~stealing~ taking advantage of input and advice from a wide variety of talent in
the Bevy community makes a lot of sense.

Plus, I figure there are plenty of other people out there like me. I've been the beneficiary of
freely available written content so many times I've lost count. You only have to look at great
resources like [Unofficial Bevy Cheat Book](https://bevy-cheatbook.github.io/) or, hell,
[SICP](https://mitp-content-server.mit.edu/books/content/sectbyfn/books_pres_0/6515/sicp.zip/full-text/book/book.html).
In my own small way, I'd like to give back into that world. For all those old, slow programmers out
there. (And anyone else who needs to look something up).

### Editing

The only other requirement to contribute is that you not take it personally if I elect to rework the
submission a little for clarity, or to keep the style consistent with the rest of the text. It'll
never be personal, I promise!

## The legal stuff

To leave the way open to publishing a physical or e-book copy of this book, contributions will be
covered by a [Contributor License Agreement](CLA.md). If it looks familiar, that's because it's
[Apache's Individual CLA](https://www.apache.org/licenses/icla.pdf). We manage the process using a
GitHub Action ([CLA Assistant](https://github.com/contributor-assistant/github-action)) so it's
fairly painless. It'll pop up during your first pull request.

## Other ways to help out

You don't have to write anything to contribute. If you have an idea, a bug report, corrections, or
suggestions, feel free to [file an issue](https://github.com/eloquentgeek/bfac/issues/new). Can't
promise I'll get to it right away, but I'll definitely see it.

## Community

The [Eloquent Geek Discord](https://discord.gg/sAC7GESTyK) is a good place to get in touch, ask
questions or hang out. I'm also on the [Bevy Discord](https://discord.gg/EhrPuaT3QY) and you should
be too, it's a fantastic resource.

I stream on [Twitch](https://twitch.tv/basie) and [YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/@eloquentgeekgames), mostly working on Bevy gamedev. Happy to field questions there too.
