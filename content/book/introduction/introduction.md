## What this book is

This is a summary of everything I'm learning about game development with Bevy Engine. In very large
part, it's an "on the shoulders of giants" situation. Almost everything I know is either from being
told useful tidbits by maintainers and other experienced folks in the community. Or from long and
painful experimentation and poring over documentation, or a combination of all these things.

Wherever possible, I assume zero game development experience. That's where I started, so many of
these topics were quite foreign to me. Some of them still are, so the process of writing about them
and learning about them are relatively close together.

## What it isn't

An erudite treatise by an expert in the field. Seriously, if you're looking for a rendering guru or
gamedev savant you've come to the wrong place.

It's also not a Rust programming language tutorial. For that, you'll want to start with [The Rust
Programming Language](https://doc.rust-lang.org/book/) and move on to a wide variety of online and
print resources.

Finally, it's not an official project or document of the [Bevy
Foundation](https://bevyengine.org/foundation/) in any way.

## The game

This book is also a record of the development of a 2D Bevy game, [All the Way Home](https://github.com/eloquentgeek/all-the-way-home). It's a take on the Lemmings tradition. I regret never learning [68000 assembler](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Motorola_68000), so this is my attempt to recapture the Amiga 500 glory days of my youth.
